# Time spent : 6 hours

# New librairies :
I chose to use React query & Axios to have a better integration of API requests.
I try to follow your conventions so I have not installed prettier.

# Paths :
- '/' -> list of conversations
- '/conversation/:id' -> Each conversation

# Features :
- Display conversation list with link to conversation
- Create a new conversation
- Send a message
- Errors handling

# The first improvements I would have made if I had had a little more time :
- Skeletons
- Typography components
- Modal base component
- Install stylelint
